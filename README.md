# Android : Most Important Topics

# Clean Architecture
- Clean Architecture is a software design pattern that organizes code into distinct layers, separating concerns and dependencies. The layers are typically:
- 1.Presentation Layer: Handles the UI and user interactions (e.g., Activities, Fragments, ViewModel).
- 2.Domain Layer: Contains business logic and use cases. It’s independent of any frameworks.
- 3.Data Layer: Manages data sources like APIs, databases, and repositories.

- Why do we need Clean Architecture in Android?

    - Testability: Layers are independent, making unit testing easier.
    - Scalability: The app becomes modular and easier to maintain as it grows.
   -  Flexibility: Allows swapping data sources (e.g., changing from SQLite to Room) without affecting other layers.
    - Separation of Concerns: Each layer has a specific role, improving code readability and maintainability.

# SOLID Principles
S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

    Definition: A class should have only one reason to change. It should have one job or responsibility.
    Why we need it: Reduces the risk of introducing bugs when making changes to the class.
    Example: A User class should only handle user details, not database operations or authentication.

O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

    Definition: A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    Why we need it: Allows adding new features without altering existing code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
    Example: Use interfaces or inheritance to extend functionality instead of modifying existing classes.

L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

    Definition: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the program's behavior.
    Why we need it: Prevents unexpected behavior when using polymorphism.
    Example: A Square class should not break the behavior of a Rectangle class if it inherits from it.

I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

    Definition: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
    Why we need it: Keeps interfaces specific to the needs of the client, reducing unnecessary dependencies.
    Example: Instead of a single Animal interface with unrelated methods like fly() and swim(), split it into smaller interfaces like Flyable and Swimmable.

D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

    Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
    Why we need it: Promotes loose coupling between components, making the system more flexible.
    Example: A Notification class should depend on an abstraction (Notifier) rather than concrete classes like EmailNotifier or SMSNotifier.

## ANDROID
## Core Building Blocks or Fundamental Components:

- **Activity** - Represents a single screen with a user interface
- **Views** - UI components for creating the user interface
- **Intents** - Facilitate communication between different components or apps
- **Services** - Long running background process. or Execute background tasks without a UI
- **Content Providers** - Used to share data between the apps
- **Fragments** - A modular portion of the user interface within an activity
- **Android Manifest** - Contains essential metadata about the application

## Activity Lifecycle:
- **onCreate()**: Called when the activity is first created. This is where initialization occurs.
- **onStart()**: Called when the activity becomes visible to the user.
- **onResume()**: Called when the activity starts interacting with the user. This is typically where animations and other things that require CPU resources should be started.
- **onPause()**: Called when the activity is partially obscured by another activity. This is a good place to commit unsaved changes or pause ongoing processes.
- **onStop()**: Called when the activity is no longer visible to the user.
- **onDestroy()**: Called before the activity is destroyed. This is where you should release any resources that aren't needed anymore.
- **OnRestart()**: Called when the activity has been stopped and is restarting again.

## Fragment Lifecycle:
 * Fragments are reusable UI components within activities. They have their own lifecycle methods similar to activities
- **onAttach()**: Attaches the fragment to its hosting activity.
- **onCreate()**: Initializes the fragment.
- **onCreateView()**: Creates the fragment's UI.
- **onViewCreated()**: Called after onCreateView() to initialize UI components.
- **onActivityCreated()**: Activity's onCreate() has completed; fragment's activity is fully initialized.
- **onStart()**: Fragment becomes visible.
- **onResume()**: Fragment starts interacting with the user.
- **onPause()**: Fragment no longer interacts with the user.
- **onStop()**: Fragment is no longer visible.
- **onDestroyView()**: Removes the fragment's UI.
- **onDestroy()**: Releases resources before the fragment is destroyed.
- **onDetach()**: Detaches the fragment from its hosting activity.

## Jetpack Components:
- **ViewModel**: Part of the Android Architecture Components. It is used to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware manner, surviving configuration changes such as screen rotations.
- **LiveData**: An observable data holder class that notifies UI components when data changes. It’s lifecycle-aware, meaning it only updates active observers.
- **Navigation Component**: Simplifies the implementation of navigation between screens and supports features like deep linking and safe arguments.
- **Paging**: A component that allows users to load and display large data sets with infinite scrolling
- **Jetpack Compose**: A Kotlin-based toolkit for building native UI
- **Android KTX**: A library that increases support for the Kotlin language for app development 
- **WorkManager**: Used for background tasks that need guaranteed execution, such as periodic data syncing.
- **Room**: An abstraction layer over SQLite that handles database creation and management with type-safe access to database queries.
- **ViewBinding and DataBinding:** ViewBinding is a simpler approach for binding views, while DataBinding allows more complex UI bindings, supporting data binding expressions in XML layouts.

## RecyclerView
- A more advanced and flexible version of ListView, used to display a large number of items efficiently.
  Adapter and ViewHolder patterns are key concepts for recycling views and improving performance.
  DiffUtil: Used for calculating the difference between two lists and updating only the items that have changed.
- Async Image Loading:Use image-loading libraries like Glide or Picasso to load images asynchronously, preventing UI freezes.
- RecyclerView is a newer, more flexible option than ListView for displaying lists in Android apps.

## Networking
- Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for Android used for making network requests and parsing responses using converters like Gson or Moshi.
OkHttp: A powerful HTTP client that supports features like interceptors for handling custom headers and logging.
Handling errors (e.g., network failures, HTTP status codes) and using try-catch or custom error handling mechanisms.

## Data Storage:
- SharedPreferences: Simple key-value storage for saving small amounts of primitive data.
- Room Database: Structured storage using SQL with support for complex queries.
- SQLite: A database option for more manual management of structured data.

## Dependency Injection:

- Dagger 2: A compile-time dependency injection framework providing dependency management and injection with minimal runtime overhead.
- Hilt: A simpler way to integrate Dagger 2, making it easier to set up and use in Android projects.
- Koin: A lightweight dependency injection library for Kotlin that’s easy to learn and integrate.

## Multithreading and Background Work:

- Handler and Looper: Used for communicating between background threads and the main thread.
- WorkManager: Manages background tasks that should run even if the app is closed or the device is rebooted.
- Coroutines provide a modern approach to handle background work more efficiently compared to older methods like AsyncTask.
    
## Android Context Two types
- 1.Application Context - need to access resources that are not tied to any specific activity, use the Application context.
- 2.Activity Context - need to access resources that are tied to a specific activity, use the Activity context
- It allows us to access resources.
- It allows us to interact with other Android components by sending messages.
- It gives you information about your app environment.

## Image Loading libraries
- Picasso
- Glide
- Fresco
- COIL (Coroutine Image Loader)
- UIL (Universal Image Loader)

# Serializable:

    Java-native interface.
    Slower due to reflection.
    Increases memory overhead.

# Parcelable:

    Android-specific.
    Faster and optimized for IPC (Inter-Process Communication).
    Requires manual implementation.

# MVVM, MVC, MVP

    MVC: Separates UI (View), Business Logic (Controller), and Data (Model).
    MVP: Similar to MVC, but Presenter handles business logic and updates the View.
    MVVM: ViewModel holds UI-related data and logic, and updates the View through LiveData/Flow.

# Java Garbage Collection

Java garbage collection is an automatic memory management process where unused objects are identified and removed to free memory, using techniques like mark-and-sweep.
Pending Intent

# Pending intend

A PendingIntent is a tokenized intent that allows another application (e.g., a system service) to perform an action on behalf of your application. It's commonly used in notifications and alarms.

MVVM, MVC, MVP

    MVC: Separates UI (View), Business Logic (Controller), and Data (Model).
    MVP: Similar to MVC, but Presenter handles business logic and updates the View.
    MVVM: ViewModel holds UI-related data and logic, and updates the View through LiveData/Flow.

# ViewModel Use and Features

A ViewModel stores and manages UI-related data across configuration changes, ensuring lifecycle awareness and separation of concerns.
Use ViewModel, onSaveInstanceState(), or android:configChanges in the manifest to handle configuration changes.

# Doze and App Standby

    Doze: Optimizes battery by deferring background tasks when the device is idle.
    App Standby: Limits background activity for unused apps.

# Git Merge and Git Rebase

    Merge: Combines branches, preserving commit history.
    Rebase: Reapplies commits from one branch onto another, creating a linear history.

# Runnable vs Callable

    Runnable: Represents a task with no return value.
    Callable: Represents a task with a return value and can throw exceptions.
